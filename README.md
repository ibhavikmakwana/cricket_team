A Flutter application that demonstrate simple CRUD operations with Firebase cloud database.

## Add Firebase to your app

1. Create a Firebase project. Check out the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) documentation for setting up the firebase in your flutter application.
2. Create a new Firebase console project
3. Add [Cloud Firestore](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/cloud_firestore) to the project in the pubspec.yaml
4. Drop the created *google-services.json* in *android/app*

## Gradles

Changes to the *android/build.gradle*:

```gradle
buildscript {
        repositories {
            ...
        }

        dependencies {
            ...
            classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.2.1' // Google Services plugin
        }
    }
```

And then we have the *android/app/build.gradle*:

```gradle
//bottom of file
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```
